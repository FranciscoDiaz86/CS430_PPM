## Usage
This program takes in three command line variables which are: The PPM number to select the right converstion,
the input PPM file that has the image to convert, and the output PPM file that will be the new converted file.

Example command line prompt:

ppmrw 3 input.ppm output.ppm -- Will convert P3 to P6
ppmrw 6 input.ppm output.ppm -- Will convert P6 to P3

## Known Issues
I have ran the program and have not had any issues, but I was not able to test a RGBA files to see if it
will handle that right by giving an error message.
